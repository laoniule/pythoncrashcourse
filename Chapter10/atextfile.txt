Book Catalog Search
If you already know what book you want to read, you may search our book catalog for author, title, or subjects. Subject headings are what are known as controlled-vocabulary terms, from the U.S. Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Subject searching is, therefore, not the same as full text searching.
Freshness: Search is always up to date as to titles and authors. Subjects may be updated later.
Other Search Engines
Yahoo
Project Gutenberg is a participant in Yahoo!'s Content Acquisition Program. This provides a search of book metadata (author, title, brief description, keywords). 
Freshness: updated weekly.
